# iHusky

Our project intends to bring the UW community a more convenient and accessible way of getting around campus.

We are building a mobile version of the Husky Card for:
* Payment in Public Transportation
* Building Access in UW Facilities
* Payment in UW Facilities 
* And more.

By adding Husky IDs with Apple Wallet, UW students and staff no longer need to spend time fumbling for the physical ID.
It will also help minimize the need for plastic cards, which can toll both a student’s finances and planet earth.
We aim to build upon the UW’s Sustainability Action Plan.

Technologies we intend to use to engineer our idea are:
* GitHub (version control)
* Figma (wireframe)
* Apple Wallet API (pass)
* NFC (protocol to exchange data)
* JSON (format to exchange data)
